##Project Description

Fit Life is a health progress tracking app. Using Python, Django, Crispy Forms, and Bootstrap, a user is able to log their workouts, meals, and set goals for themselves. Once goals are set, a user is able to mark those as accomplished as well.

## Silver
1. There will be a calendar that generates on the dashboard page, on each day there will be small icon that appears if you logged any meals, goals, or workouts.

2. Different motivational quotes will appear on the dashboard page every time a user logs in. These would be pulled from an API or manually generated by me.

3. There will be a 'add additional fields' button on the add meal, add workout, and set goals pages.


## Gold
1. A chat/messenger will appear when you login where you can chat with a personal trainer to mention any setbacks you are having or need any tips!

2. Social authentication (Facebook and Twitter).
